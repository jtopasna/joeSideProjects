**Project 1 Name: Level 1 - Expiration Manager**
This Google appscript is a sophisticated version of mailmerge that allows users to send notifications depending on whether or not a particular 'item' has expired. For example, if an item type 'milk' expired on 04/01/2018, then the script can send an HTML-formatted email notifications to the 'owner' of the milk. This idea can be extended to other things (i.e. visas, licenses, certifications, etc.)

04/08UPDATE:
Next phase in development to automatically create google calendar reminders.

Using a Twilio API, can be easily extended to include SMS notifications and reminders.


**Project 2 Name: RubyTextAnalyzer**
This Ruby script enables a user to get stats on a particular text or texts. The script will summarize word count, the number of "meaningful" words, the TEN MOST COMMON significant words. **The script will also output an 'abstract' that pulls ideal / meaninful sentences together.**  



**Project 3 Name: High Score Game**
This C++ command-line "game" records high-score data for a fictitious game. The program
 asks the user how many scores they will enter, each of which will correspond to
 a different student.
 
 The program will ask the user how many names/scores they will enter, and it will use one DYNAMIC ARRAY of structs which will store user input.
 
 It will store the data in the dynamically allocated array of structs and print out the results in descending order.
 

**Project 4 Name: Fraction Class**
This C++ project creates a Fraction Class, and it overloads the operators to handle dealing with fractions (e.g. the class will allow users to add two fractions (1/2 + 1/2), multiply (1/3*4/3), divide (2/1 / 3/2), etc. using the standard operators.


**Project 5 Name: 'Poker Hand' Analyzer**
This C++ command line game reads five cards from the user, then analyzes the cards
 and prints out the category of hand that they represent. Poker hands are categorized according to the following labels: Straight flush, four of a kind, full house, straight, flush, three of a kind, two pairs, pair, 
 high card. To make things easier, the game ignores suits and face cards.

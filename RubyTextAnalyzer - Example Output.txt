===ABSTRACT===
 If national pride is ever justifiable or excusable it is when it springs, not from power or riches, grandeur or glory, but from conviction of national innocence, information, and benevolence
 In its general principles and great outlines it was conformable to such a system of government as I had ever most esteemed, and in some States, my own native State in particular, had contributed to establish
 Measures were pursued to concert a plan to form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty
 Can authority be more amiable and respectable when it descends from accidents or institutions established in remote antiquity than when it springs fresh from the hearts and judgments of an honest and enlightened people
 If an election is to be determined by a majority of a single vote, and that can be procured by a party through artifice or corruption, the Government may be the choice of a party for its own ends, not of the nation for the national good
 Returning to the bosom of my country after a painful separation from it for ten years, I had the honor to be elected to a station under the new order of things, and I have repeatedly laid myself under the most serious obligations to support the Constitution
 Claiming a right of suffrage, in common with my fellow-citizens, in the adoption or rejection of a constitution which was to rule me and my posterity, as well as them and theirs, I did not hesitate to express my approbation of it on all occasions, in public and in private

===ABSTRACT===
 The dangers of a concentration of all power in the general government of a confederacy so vast as ours are too obvious to be disregarded
 Let it be impressed upon all hearts that, beautiful as our fabric is, no earthly power or wisdom could ever reunite its broken fragments
 It must be felt that there is no national security but in the nation's humble, acknowledged dependence upon God and His overruling providence
 It was not a presumptuous assurance, but a calm faith, springing from a clear view of the sources of power in a government constituted like ours
 Higher objects than personal aggrandizement gave direction and energy to their exertions in the late canvass, and they shall not be disappointed
 I hold that the laws of 1850, commonly called the "compromise measures," are strictly constitutional and to be unhesitatingly carried into effect
 With an experience thus suggestive and cheering, the policy of my Administration will not be controlled by any timid forebodings of evil from expansion

 We are not just discussing limits on a further increase of nuclear weapons
 Human freedom is on the march, and nowhere more so than our own hemisphere

 America must remain freedom's staunchest friend, for freedom is our best ally

===ABSTRACT===
 Such a proposition is at variance with the American instinct, and will find no support, in my judgment, when submitted to the American people
 It will furnish absolute security which makes the proposed scheme of government guaranty of deposits so alluring, without its pernicious results
 The office of an inaugural address is to give a summary outline of the main policies of the new administration, so far as they can be anticipated
 I have had the honor to be one of the advisers of my distinguished predecessor, and, as such, to hold up his hands in the reforms he has initiated
 Therefore the Executive, in recognizing the negro race by appointments, must exercise a careful discretion not thereby to do it more harm than good
 The consideration of this question can not, however, be complete and full without reference to the negro race, its progress and its present condition
 On the other hand, we must be careful not to encourage the mere pretense of race feeling manufactured in the interest of individual political ambition

 But it is not enough to achieve these purposes alone
 The democratic aspiration is no mere recent phase in human history
 For this we muster the spirit of America, and the faith of America
 And yet we all understand what it is--the spirit--the faith of America
 The life of a nation is the fullness of the measure of its will to live
 The life of a man is three-score years and ten: a little more, a little less
 In Washington's day the task of the people was to create and weld together a nation

 In tendering this homage to the Great Author of every public and private good, I assure myself that it expresses your sentiments not less than my own, nor those of my fellow-citizens at large less than either
 When I was first honored with a call into the service of my country, then on the eve of an arduous struggle for its liberties, the light in which I contemplated my duty required that I should renounce every pecuniary compensation
Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives: Among the vicissitudes incident to life no event could have filled me with greater anxieties than that of which the notification was transmitted by your order, and received on the 14th day of the present month
" The circumstances under which I now meet you will acquit me from entering into that subject further than to refer to the great constitutional charter under which you are assembled, and which, in defining your powers, designates the objects to which your attention is to be given
 It will be more consistent with those circumstances, and far more congenial with the feelings which actuate me, to substitute, in place of a recommendation of particular measures, the tribute that is due to the talents, the rectitude, and the patriotism which adorn the characters selected to devise and adopt them
 Besides the ordinary objects submitted to your care, it will remain with your judgment to decide how far an exercise of the occasional power delegated by the fifth article of the Constitution is rendered expedient at the present juncture by the nature of objections which have been urged against the system, or by the degree of inquietude which has given birth to them
 On the other hand, the magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my country called me, being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications, could not but overwhelm with despondence one who (inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpracticed in the duties of civil administration) ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies

===ABSTRACT===
 Under a wise policy the debts contracted in our Revolution and during the War of 1812 have been happily extinguished
 None of the present States will be responsible for them any more than they are for the local institutions of each other
 Does he expect to find among the ruins of this Union a happier abode for our swarming millions than they now have under it
 No one of these interests can rightfully claim an advantage over the others, or to be enriched by impoverishing the others
 Whatever is good or evil in the local institutions of Texas will remain her own whether annexed to the United States or not
 The burdens of government should as far as practicable be distributed justly and equally among all classes of our population
 In taking "care that the laws be faithfully executed," a strict performance of duty will be exacted from all public officers

===ABSTRACT===
 The last, perhaps the greatest, of the prominent sources of discord and disaster supposed to lurk in our political condition was the institution of domestic slavery
 Most carefully were all these circumstances weighed, and the foundations of the new Government laid upon principles of reciprocal concession and equitable compromise
 Half a century, teeming with extraordinary events, and elsewhere producing astonishing results, has passed along, but on our institutions it has left no injurious mark
 In justly balancing the powers of the Federal and State authorities difficulties nearly insurmountable arose at the outset and subsequent collisions were deemed inevitable
 In imitating their example I tread in the footsteps of illustrious men, whose superiors it is our happiness to believe are not found on the executive calendar of any country
 To enter on this occasion into a further or more minute exposition of my views on the various questions of domestic policy would be as obtrusive as it is probably unexpected
 From time to time embarrassments have certainly occurred; but how just is the confidence of future safety imparted by the knowledge that each in succession has been happily removed

 Nor is the question before us whether the market is a force for good or ill
 Yet, every so often the oath is taken amidst gathering clouds and raging storms
 We are a nation of Christians and Muslims, Jews and Hindus -- and non-believers
that the city and the country, alarmed at one common danger, came forth to meet (it)
 So let us mark this day with remembrance, of who we are and how far we have traveled

 The agents they have chosen to carry out their purposes are bound by their promises not less than by the command of their masters to devote themselves unremittingly to this service
 Fully impressed with the gravity of the duties that confront me and mindful of my weakness, I should be appalled if it were my lot to bear unaided the responsibilities which await me
 If in lifting burdens from the daily life of our people we reduce inordinate and unequal advantages too long enjoyed, this is but a necessary incident of our return to right and justice
 These aggregations and combinations frequently constitute conspiracies against the interests of the people, and in all their phases they are unnatural and opposed to our American sense of fairness
 At the same time, in our efforts to adjust differences of opinion we should be free from intolerance or passion, and our judgments should be unmoved by alluring phrases and unvexed by selfish interests
 I find also much comfort in remembering that my countrymen are just and generous and in the assurance that they will not condemn those who by sincere devotion to their service deserve their forbearance and approval
 The lessons of paternalism ought to be unlearned and the better lesson taught that while the people should patriotically and cheerfully support their Government its functions do not include the support of the people

 How the public debt is to be paid or specie payments resumed is not so important as that a plan should be adopted and acquiesced in
 I have taken this oath without mental reservation and with the determination to do to the best of my ability all that is required of me
 Whilst the question of specie payments is in abeyance the prudent business man is careful about contracting debts payable in the distant future
 To protect the national honor, every dollar of Government indebtedness should be paid in gold, unless otherwise expressly stipulated in the contract

===ABSTRACT===
 It may be said, indeed, that the Constitution has given to the Executive the power to annul the acts of the legislative body by refusing to them his assent
 To assist or control Congress, then, in its ordinary legislation could not, I conceive, have been the motive for conferring the veto power on the President
 Being in the latter condition when the Constitution was formed, no words used in that instrument could have been intended to deprive them of that character
 It was the beautiful remark of a distinguished English writer that "in the Roman senate Octavius had a party and Anthony a party, but the Commonwealth had none
 The negative upon the acts of the legislative by the executive authority, and that in the hands of one individual, would seem to be an incongruity in our system
 Jefferson early saw and lamented this error, and attempts have been made, hitherto without success, to apply the amendatory power of the States to its correction
 It was proper, therefore, to provide some umpire from whose situation and mode of appointment more independence and freedom from such influences might be expected

 To be indifferent to it, or independent of it, was out of the question
 Upon this as a platform of purpose and of action we can stand together
 And yet all the while we have been conscious that we were not part of it
 In that consciousness, despite many divisions, we have drawn closer together
 Our own fortunes as a nation are involved whether we would have it so or not
 They are too deeply rooted in the principles of our national life to be altered

===ABSTRACT===
 These differences between communism and democracy do not concern the United States alone
 We are aided by all who desire self-government and a voice in deciding their own affairs
 We have consistently advocated and relied upon peaceful settlement of disputes among nations
 The American people stand firm in the faith which has inspired this Nation from the beginning
 What we envisage is a program of development based on the concepts of democratic fair-dealing
 We are aided by all who want relief from the lies of propaganda--who desire truth and sincerity
 Communism holds that the world is so deeply divided into opposing classes that war is inevitable

 We have more will than wallet; but will is what we need
 That we were more driven to succeed than anyone around us
 Assistance can be shown here, and will be long remembered
 And so, there is much to do; and tomorrow the work begins
 I do not mistrust the future; I do not fear what is ahead
 We need harmony; we have had a chorus of discordant voices
 For this is the thing: This is the age of the offered hand

 No nation, however old or great, escapes this tempest of change and turmoil
 The divisive force is International Communism and the power that it controls
 Everywhere we see the seeds of the same growth that America itself has known
 So we voice our hope and our belief that we can help to heal this divided world

===ABSTRACT===
Fellow-Citizens: Under Providence I have been called a second time to act as Executive over this great nation
 It has been, and is, my earnest desire to correct abuses that have grown up in the civil service of the country
 It was not a question of my seeking, but was a proposition from the people of Santo Domingo, and which I entertained
 To secure this reformation rules regulating methods of appointment and promotions were established and have been tried
 My best efforts will be given in the same direction in the future, aided, I trust, by my four years' experience in the office
 In the first year of the past Administration the proposition came up for the admission of Santo Domingo as a Territory of the Union
 If the effort is made in good faith, we will stand better before the civilized nations of the earth and in our own consciences for having made it

 I am convinced that you will again give that support to leadership in these critical days
 Plenty is at our doorstep, but a generous use of it languishes in the very sight of the supply
 There are many ways in which it can be helped, but it can never be helped merely by talking about it
 The basic thought that guides these specific means of national recovery is not narrowly nationalistic

 Let us restore to social intercourse that harmony and affection without which liberty and even life itself are but dreary things
 And may that Infinite Power which rules the destinies of the universe lead our councils to what is best, and give them a favorable issue for your peace and prosperity
 I believe it the only one where every man, at the call of the law, would fly to the standard of the law, and would meet invasions of the public order as his own personal concern
 Relying, then, on the patronage of your good will, I advance with obedience to the work, ready to retire from it whenever you become sensible how much better choice it is in your power to make
 If there be any among us who would wish to dissolve this Union or to change its republican form, let them stand undisturbed as monuments of the safety with which error of opinion may be tolerated where reason is left free to combat it
 Utterly, indeed, should I despair did not the presence of many whom I here see remind me that in the other high authorities provided by our Constitution I shall find resources of wisdom, of virtue, and of zeal on which to rely under all difficulties

 I can not but hope that by the same process of friendly, patient, and persevering deliberation all constitutional objections will ultimately be removed
 It has passed away in a period of profound peace, how much to the satisfaction of our country and to the honor of our country's name is known to you all
 Ten years of peace, at home and abroad, have assuaged the animosities of political contention and blended into harmony the most discordant elements of public opinion
 Union, justice, tranquillity, the common defense, the general welfare, and the blessings of liberty--all have been promoted by the Government under which we have lived

Elected by the American people to the highest office known to our laws, I appear here to take the oath prescribed by the Constitution, and, in compliance with a time-honored custom, to address those who are now assembled
 So far as it is possible to be informed, I shall make honesty, capacity, and fidelity indispensable prerequisites to the bestowal of office, and the absence of either of these qualities shall be deemed sufficient cause for removal
" For the interpretation of that instrument I shall look to the decisions of the judicial tribunals established by its authority and to the practice of the Government under the earlier Presidents, who had so large a share in its formation
 I shall look with confidence to the enlightened patriotism of that body to adopt such measures of conciliation as may harmonize conflicting interests and tend to perpetuate that Union which should be the paramount object of our hopes and affections
 As American freemen we can not but sympathize in all efforts to extend the blessings of civil and political liberty, but at the same time we are warned by the admonitions of history and the voice of our own beloved Washington to abstain from entangling alliances with foreign nations
 In reference to the Army and Navy, lately employed with so much distinction on active service, care shall be taken to insure the highest condition of efficiency, and in furtherance of that object the military and naval schools, sustained by the liberality of Congress, shall receive the special attention of the Executive

 Abroad and at home, the key to those new responsibilities lies in the placing and the division of responsibility
 It is important that we understand both the necessity and the limitations of America's role in maintaining that peace

 It may be proper that on this occasion I should make some brief remarks in regard to our rights and duties as a member of the great family of nations

===ABSTRACT===
 It is a propitious consideration that an unavoidable war should have found this seasonable facility for the contributions required to support it
 Still more precise advances were repeated, and have been received in a spirit forbidding every reliance not placed on the military resources of the nation
 To render the justice of the war on our part the more conspicuous, the reluctance to commence it was followed by the earliest and strongest manifestations of a disposition to arrest its progress
 Not to contend for such a stake is to surrender our equality with other powers on the element common to all and to violate the sacred title which every member of the society has to its protection
 On the issue of the war are staked our national sovereignty on the high seas and the security of an important class of citizens whose occupations give the proper value to those of every other class
 And now we find them, in further contempt of the modes of honorable warfare, supplying the place of a conquering force by attempts to disorganize our political society, to dismember our confederated Republic
 To render the war short and its success sure, animated and systematic exertions alone are necessary, and the success of our arms now may long preserve our country from the necessity of another resort to them

 I know that the acquisition of Louisiana had been disapproved by some from a candid apprehension that the enlargement of our territory would endanger its union
 These abuses of an institution so important to freedom and science are deeply to be regretted, inasmuch as they tend to lessen its usefulness and to sap its safety
 That is due, in the first place, to the reflecting character of our citizens at large, who, by the weight of public opinion, influence and strengthen the public measures
 During this course of administration, and in order to disturb it, the artillery of the press has been leveled against us, charged with whatsoever its licentiousness could devise or dare
 The larger our association the less will it be shaken by local passions; and in any view is it not better that the opposite bank of the Mississippi should be settled by our own brethren and children than by strangers of another family
 These, covering our land with officers and opening our doors to their intrusions, had already begun that process of domiciliary vexation which once entered is scarcely to be restrained from reaching successively every article of property and produce

 The event of the existing crisis will be decisive in the opinion of mankind of the practicability of our federal system of government

 These great objects are necessarily connected, and can only be attained by an enlightened exercise of the powers of each within its appropriate sphere in conformity with the public will constitutionally expressed

 In the domestic policy of this Government there are two objects which especially deserve the attention of the people and their representatives, and which have been and will continue to be the subjects of my increasing solicitude
 For their approbation of my public conduct through a period which has not been without its difficulties, and for this renewed expression of their confidence in my good intentions, I am at a loss for terms adequate to the expression of my gratitude
